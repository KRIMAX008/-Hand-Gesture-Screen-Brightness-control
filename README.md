# -Hand-Gesture-Screen-Brightness-control
Just do the actions of zooming(pinching) in or out with your fingers and the brightness of your primary display monitor increases or decreases as you wish! This is an elegant project work which simply runs in background if you make it an executable file and use it for smart home and IOT project's.I created this using the mediapipe ,openCV ,screen brightness control by crozzers and numpy modules and the coding is just within 60 lines!
I have also attached the HandTracking module so if you have proior knowledge to use the classes and fuctions in other programs give it a try.
